### Notes

- Learned not to pursue money or titles at hedge fund
- Reckless commitment - doing something when you're not ready; figuring it out as you go along (agreeing to do a talk on an overwhelming subject months in advance)
- Tension between Tech lead and business manager (cofounders)
- Key person from company asks for coffee its an acquisition meeting
- Key lessons from startup experience: 
    - Network: 
    - Storytelling: 
        - Big deals, execs don't want to see the demo, they want a good story
        - Rational vs emotional: Make someone feel someway about what you're selling
        - Unspoken conclusions - can you lead people down a path that lets them conclude you're x (don't say it)
        - Leverage novelty for attention
        - Priming vs surprising (non-obvious priming as not to insult)
        - Know your audience (how do they get promoted)
- Build AI that shuts off TV if kids leave room messy
- Escape the zoo (ai enables you to get away from mundane tasks that keep you from being creative)
