# Graph Data Science: The Secret Ingredient for Relationship-Driven AI
## November 2, 2022
## Katie Roberts, PhD

### Notes
- Graphs are a way to represent relationships between entities
- Traditional ML models are not good at representing relationships
- Cold start problem: when you don't have enough data to make a prediction (new customer, new product, etc)
- Components of a graph:
    - Nodes: entities 
    - Relationships: edges
    - Properties: attributes of nodes and relationships
- 

### Investigate
- Applying graph theory to adobe data enriched with customer data
- Graph algorithms? 
    - Link prediction
- Time stamp edges?
